# Deterrence, Compellence & Coercive Diplomacy

**QGIA Knowledge Library - Theoretical Foundations**

## Overview

Deterrence seeks to prevent adversary action through threat of unacceptable consequences. Compellence seeks to force adversary action change through coercive pressure. Coercive diplomacy combines threats with inducements and negotiation. Understanding the logic, requirements, and failure modes of each strategy is essential for forecasting crisis dynamics and evaluating policy options.

## Core Concepts

### Deterrence Theory

**Definition**: Use of threats to prevent adversary from initiating undesired action.

**Central Logic**: Defender communicates that costs of aggression will outweigh benefits, making attack irrational.

**Requirements for Success**:
1. **Capability**: Possession of means to impose unacceptable costs
2. **Credibility**: Adversary believes defender will carry out threat
3. **Communication**: Threat clearly understood by adversary
4. **Rationality**: Adversary conducts cost-benefit analysis

**Types of Deterrence**:
- **Deterrence by denial**: Convince adversary cannot achieve objectives militarily
- **Deterrence by punishment**: Threaten retaliation that outweighs gains
- **Immediate deterrence**: Prevent imminent attack during specific crisis
- **General deterrence**: Prevent aggression in normal peacetime conditions
- **Extended deterrence**: Protect allies through threat of retaliation

**The Credibility Problem**: Threats must be believable to work, but incentives to bluff create doubt. Credibility enhanced through:
- Sunk costs (forward deployed forces)
- Reputation for resolve
- Tying hands (public commitments, audience costs)
- Automatic response mechanisms (tripwires)
- Demonstrating irrationality or uncontrollability

**Nuclear Deterrence**: Massive destructive power makes threats credible for homeland defense but creates extended deterrence dilemma: Would US risk New York to save Berlin?

**Intelligence Application**:
- Assess whether defender has required capabilities
- Evaluate adversary's perception of defender credibility
- Monitor for signals undermining deterrence (force withdrawals, equivocal statements)
- Identify conditions under which deterrence might fail

### Compellence Theory

**Definition**: Use of threats or limited force to compel adversary to change behavior or relinquish something already possessed.

**Key Difference from Deterrence**: Compellence requires adversary action (withdrawal, policy change), while deterrence requires inaction. Compellence is therefore harder:
- Demands explicit concession (loss of face)
- Requires adversary to take first step toward compliance
- Uncertain about what level of pressure sufficient
- Time-urgent, creating risk of preemption

**Schelling's Framework**: Compellence is "forcible persuasion" combining threats with actual application of force:
- **Try-and-see**: Gradually increase pressure until adversary yields
- **Tacit ultimatum**: Increase costs steadily without stating threshold
- **Brinkmanship**: Manipulate risk of mutual catastrophe

**Requirements for Success**:
1. **Clarity**: Adversary understands exactly what is demanded
2. **Achievability**: Demands within adversary's capability to fulfill
3. **Urgency**: Time pressure forcing decision
4. **Assurance**: Credible promise to halt coercion if compliance occurs
5. **Proportionality**: Threatened costs proportionate to stakes

**Common Failure Modes**:
- Demands too ambitious (regime change)
- Adversary values stakes more than coercer estimates
- Insufficient means applied
- Lack of off-ramp preventing face-saving compliance
- Escalation spirals from action-reaction dynamics

**Intelligence Application**:
- Assess adversary's valuation of stakes
- Evaluate whether demands achievable politically/militarily
- Monitor for indicators adversary willing to comply
- Identify potential off-ramps enabling settlement

### Coercive Diplomacy

**Alexander George's Framework**: Coercive diplomacy is the defensive use of threats and limited force to persuade adversary to halt or reverse encroachment.

**Variants**:
1. **Ultimatum**: Explicit demand with deadline and threat
2. **Try-and-see**: Gradual pressure escalation (e.g., Rolling Thunder in Vietnam)
3. **Gradual turning of the screw**: Slow, steady increase in pain
4. **Tacit ultimatum**: Pressure without explicit demands or deadline

**Design Considerations**:
- **Demand specificity**: Precise vs. ambiguous
- **Deadline presence**: Explicit time limit vs. open-ended
- **Threat credibility**: Demonstrable capability and resolve
- **Inducements**: Carrots alongside sticks
- **Escalation control**: Ability to calibrate pressure

**Success Factors (George's findings)**:
- Strong motivation by coercer
- Asymmetry of motivation favoring coercer
- Fear of unacceptable escalation
- Clarity about costs of compliance vs. non-compliance
- Leadership consensus on adversary side

**Intelligence Application**:
- Assess relative motivation asymmetries
- Evaluate leadership decision-making structures
- Monitor for signs coercion working (force withdrawals, negotiation shifts)
- Identify potential inducements that could facilitate settlement

## Advanced Topics

### Escalation Dominance

**Herman Kahn's Concept**: Party able to escalate to levels adversary unwilling to match achieves escalation dominance.

**Kahn's Escalation Ladder**: 44-rung ladder from sub-crisis maneuvering to spasm nuclear war:
- Rungs 1-10: Subcrisis maneuvering
- Rungs 11-20: Traditional crises
- Rungs 21-30: Intense crises
- Rungs 31-44: Nuclear exchanges (tactical → city strikes → spasm)

**Critique**: Modern analysts question whether escalation is so controllable or predictable. Escalation may be:
- Non-linear with phase transitions
- Path-dependent with unpredictable dynamics
- Subject to organizational failures and accidents
- Driven by domestic politics as much as strategic calculation

**Intelligence Application**:
- Map potential escalation pathways
- Identify escalation thresholds and firebreaks
- Assess each side's escalation capacity and tolerance
- Monitor for indicators of imminent escalation jumps

### Brinkmanship

**Schelling's Analysis**: Deliberate creation of risk that situation will spiral out of control, manipulating shared danger to extract concessions.

**Mechanism**: Not threat to launch certain attack, but threat to increase probability of uncontrolled catastrophe. "Competition in risk-taking."

**Requirements**:
- Mutual fear of disaster
- Ability to manipulate risk without triggering disaster
- Asymmetric stakes favoring risk-taker
- Communication of red lines and resolve

**Dangers**:
- Inadvertent escalation
- Misperception of adversary resolve
- Loss of control to subordinates
- Accident or technical failure triggering war

**Historical Examples**:
- Cuban Missile Crisis (1962)
- Berlin Crises (1948, 1961)
- Taiwan Strait Crises (1954-55, 1995-96)

**Intelligence Application**:
- Monitor for brinkmanship tactics (deliberate ambiguity, risk manipulation)
- Assess risk tolerance asymmetries
- Identify factors that could cause inadvertent escalation
- Track command-and-control arrangements affecting control

### Extended Deterrence

**Problem**: How to make credible commitment to defend allies when defense risks home territory?

**Solutions**:
- Forward deployed forces as tripwires
- Nuclear weapons on allied territory
- Formal treaty commitments
- Repeated demonstrations of resolve
- Shared identity or ideology

**Abandonment vs. Entrapment**:
- **Abandonment fear**: Allies worry defender won't honor commitment
- **Entrapment fear**: Defender worries allies will drag them into unwanted war

**Intelligence Application**:
- Assess credibility of extended deterrence commitments
- Monitor for allied hedging behaviors
- Evaluate adversary's perception of commitment credibility
- Track tripwire deployments and withdrawal patterns

## Intelligence Analysis Framework

### Deterrence Assessment

1. **Capability Evaluation**:
   - Does defender possess means to impose unacceptable costs?
   - Can defender deny adversary's objectives?
   - Are retaliatory forces survivable?

2. **Credibility Assessment**:
   - What sunk costs has defender committed?
   - What is defender's reputation for resolve?
   - Are there domestic political constraints on backing down?
   - Has defender tied its hands effectively?

3. **Communication Analysis**:
   - Are red lines clearly stated?
   - Does adversary understand deterrent threats?
   - Are there cultural/linguistic barriers to communication?

4. **Adversary Perception**:
   - Does adversary believe defender will retaliate?
   - How does adversary weigh potential gains vs. costs?
   - Are there cognitive biases affecting adversary's calculation?

### Compellence Monitoring

1. **Demand Evaluation**:
   - Are demands clear and achievable?
   - Do demands allow face-saving compliance?
   - Is timeline realistic?

2. **Pressure Assessment**:
   - Is coercive pressure sufficient?
   - Are escalation options available?
   - Can pressure be sustained over time?

3. **Target Analysis**:
   - How much does adversary value contested stakes?
   - Can adversary leadership agree on compliance?
   - Are there domestic political obstacles to yielding?

4. **Off-Ramp Identification**:
   - What settlement terms acceptable to both sides?
   - Are third-party mediators available?
   - Can face-saving formulas be crafted?
