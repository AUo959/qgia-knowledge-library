## Purpose and Scope

Theoretical foundations provide the conceptual frameworks for understanding state behavior, international system dynamics, and strategic interaction. These theories inform:

- **Hypothesis Generation**: Theoretical expectations about likely state actions
- **Causal Mechanisms**: Understanding why states behave as they do
- **Scenario Development**: Theory-driven alternative futures
- **Model Building**: Formal representations of strategic interaction
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring dynamics across cases

## Core Theoretical Debates

### Realism vs. Liberalism
- **Realist View**: States are rational egoists seeking power/security in anarchic system
- **Liberal View**: Institutions, democracy, and interdependence constrain conflict
- **Analytical Implications**: Different predictions about cooperation, war, alliance behavior

### Material vs. Ideational Factors
- **Materialist**: Capabilities, geography, resources drive behavior
- **Constructivist**: Ideas, identities, norms shape interests and actions
- **Analytical Implications**: Emphasis on military balance vs. narrative and legitimacy

### Rational vs. Psychological Models
- **Rational Choice**: States maximize expected utility based on preferences
- **Psychological**: Cognitive biases, emotions, misperceptions matter
- **Analytical Implications**: Assumption of optimality vs. systematic deviations

## Integration with QGIA Frameworks

### Theoretical Foundations → Quantitative Models
- **Game Theory**: Formalized in ABCP (Adaptive Bayesian Conflict Predictor)
- **Deterrence Theory**: Embedded in escalation ladder frameworks
- **Decision-Making Psychology**: Informs confidence calibration and bias mitigation

### Theory-Driven Scenario Generation
- **QSFE (Quantum Superposition Forecasting)**: Multiple theoretical lenses generate alternative futures
- **RPRN (Recursive Pattern Recognition)**: Historical pattern matching informed by theoretical expectations

## Usage Guidelines for Analysts

**1. Pre-Analysis Theory Review**
- Identify relevant theoretical frameworks for the question at hand
- Consider competing theoretical predictions
- Use theories to generate hypotheses for testing

**2. Avoid Confirmation Bias**
- Don't cherry-pick theories supporting pre-existing views
- Consider evidence that would falsify theoretical predictions
- Acknowledge theoretical uncertainty and scope conditions

**3. Practical Application**
- Theories are heuristics, not laws—expect deviations
- Context matters—scope conditions determine applicability
- Combine insights from multiple theoretical traditions

## Key Concepts by Domain

### International Relations
- **Anarchy**: Absence of world government creates security dilemma
- **Balance of Power**: States balance against threats to prevent hegemony
- **Security Dilemma**: Defensive actions appear threatening, causing arms spirals
- **Democratic Peace**: Democracies rarely fight each other
- **Hegemonic Stability**: Dominant power provides public goods (order, trade)

### Strategic Studies
- **Deterrence**: Preventing action by threat of unacceptable retaliation
- **Compellence**: Forcing action through coercive threats
- **Extended Deterrence**: Protecting allies through security guarantees
- **Escalation Dominance**: Advantage at each rung of escalation ladder
- **Credibility**: Believability of threats and promises

### Game Theory
- **Nash Equilibrium**: No player benefits from unilateral deviation
- **Subgame Perfect Equilibrium**: Credible strategies considering future play
- **Bayesian Games**: Incomplete information about opponent types/preferences
- **Repeated Games**: Cooperation sustained by shadow of the future
- **Screening/Signaling**: Revealing or concealing private information

### Decision-Making
- **Prospect Theory**: Loss aversion and reference-dependent preferences
- **Availability Heuristic**: Overweighting recent/vivid events
- **Anchoring**: Over-reliance on initial information
- **Groupthink**: Conformity pressure suppresses dissent
- **Polyheuristic Theory**: Non-compensatory elimination then expected utility

## Recommended Reading Sequence

**For New Analysts:**
1. Start with `/international-relations/realism/` and `/liberalism/` for core paradigms
2. Review `/strategic-studies/deterrence-theory/` for security applications
3. Study `/decision-making/cognitive-psychology/` for bias awareness

**For Experienced Analysts:**
1. Deep dive into `/game-theory/applications/` for formal modeling
2. Review `/strategic-studies/escalation/` for crisis dynamics
3. Consult domain-specific theories as needed for particular analyses

## Continuous Learning
