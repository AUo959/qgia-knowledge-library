## 1. REALISM PARADIGM

### 1.1 Classical Realism (Morgenthau, Carr)

**Core Tenets**:
- Human nature drives state behavior (animus dominandi - will to power)
- States as primary actors seeking power and security
- International politics as struggle for power
- National interest defined in terms of power
- Morality subordinate to survival imperatives

**Analytical Applications**:
- Great power competition dynamics
- Balance of power calculations
- Security dilemma identification
- Alliance formation based on capability aggregation

**Forecasting Implications**:
- States prioritize relative gains over absolute gains
- Power transitions create instability (Thucydides Trap)
- Military capability remains ultimate arbiter
- Cooperation unstable without hegemon or balance

**QGIA Integration**: Use for baseline great power competition assessments, territorial dispute analysis, military modernization drivers.

### 1.2 Structural Realism / Neorealism (Waltz)

**Core Tenets**:
- System structure (anarchy) determines outcomes, not unit attributes
- Distribution of capabilities defines system polarity
- States as defensive positionalists seeking survival
- Socialization and competition produce similar behaviors
- Balancing against threats is systemic imperative

**Key Predictions**:
- Bipolar systems more stable than multipolar
- Balancing behavior against rising hegemons
- Security concerns trump economic interdependence
- Arms racing as rational response to uncertainty

**Mathematical Formalization**:
Power distribution metric:
\[ P_i = \frac{C_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} C_j} \]
Where \(C_i\) represents composite capabilities (military, economic, technological) of state \(i\).

**QGIA Integration**: Polarity assessments, structural constraint identification, balancing/bandwagoning predictions.

### 1.3 Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer)

**Core Tenets**:
- States maximize relative power, not just security
- Hegemonic aspiration is rational under anarchy
- Geography constrains power projection ("stopping power of water")
- Regional hegemons prevent peer competitors in their sphere
- Revisionist behavior until regional dominance achieved

**Forecasting Framework**:
- Identify latent hegemons (states with material potential)
- Assess geographic constraints on expansion
- Predict revisionist windows when capability-intention alignment occurs
- Expected balancing coalitions against rising powers

**QGIA Integration**: China regional ambitions, Russia near-abroad policies, US sphere-of-influence defense.

### 1.4 Defensive Realism (Glaser, Van Evera)

**Core Tenets**:
- Security, not power maximization, is primary goal
- Offense-defense balance shapes war likelihood
- Security dilemma can be mitigated via signaling
- Geography and technology determine offense-defense advantage
- Cooperation possible when defense dominant

**Offense-Defense Balance Variables**:
- Technology (precision strike, ISR, fortifications)
- Geography (mountains, oceans, strategic depth)
- Force structure (mobile armor vs. fortified positions)
- Doctrinal emphasis (preemption vs. deterrence)

**QGIA Integration**: Arms control prospects, crisis stability assessments, inadvertent escalation risks.

## 2. LIBERALISM PARADIGM

### 2.1 Republican Liberalism (Democratic Peace Theory)

**Core Tenets** (Doyle, Russett):
- Democracies do not fight each other (dyadic hypothesis)
- Democratic norms constrain use of force
- Institutional checks slow mobilization
- Public accountability reduces risk-acceptance
- Transparency reduces misperception

**Empirical Support**:
- Zero interstate wars between established democracies since 1816
- Democratic dyads 50-80% less likely to experience militarized disputes
- Caveat: Democratic transitions increase conflict risk (Mann, Mansfield)

**Forecasting Applications**:
- Democratization waves create unstable transition zones
- Autocratic-democratic dyads higher war risk
- Democratic backsliding increases revisionism

**QGIA Integration**: Regime type coding for alliance reliability, transition risk monitoring.

### 2.2 Commercial Liberalism (Economic Interdependence)

**Core Tenets** (Angell, Keohane):
- Trade increases opportunity costs of war
- Interdependence creates mutual vulnerability
- Economic integration produces shared interests
- Globalization reduces zero-sum thinking
- Supply chain entanglement constrains coercion

**Quantitative Indicators**:
- Bilateral trade as % of GDP
- Investment stock interdependence
- Supply chain criticality indices
- Financial system integration depth

**Counterargument** (Realist critique):
- WWI occurred despite high interdependence
- Security externalities outweigh economic costs
- Asymmetric dependence creates leverage (weaponization)

**QGIA Integration**: Economic coercion vulnerability assessments, sanctions effectiveness forecasts.

### 2.3 Institutional Liberalism (Regime Theory)

**Core Tenets** (Keohane, Krasner):
- International institutions reduce transaction costs
- Regimes provide information, reduce uncertainty
- Iteration lengthens shadow of the future
- Institutions create focal points for coordination
- Normative frameworks constrain behavior

**Institutional Effectiveness Variables**:
- Enforcement mechanisms (sanctions, verification)
- Membership scope and commitment depth
- Institutional autonomy from great powers
- Adaptability to changing power distributions

**QGIA Integration**: Arms control compliance forecasts, multilateral coordination assessments.

## 3. CONSTRUCTIVISM PARADIGM

### 3.1 Conventional Constructivism (Wendt)

**Core Tenets**:
- Anarchy is what states make of it (socially constructed)
- Identities shape interests, interests shape behavior
- Norms constitutive, not just regulative
- Intersubjective meanings drive state action
- Agency-structure co-constitution

**Three Cultures of Anarchy**:
1. **Hobbesian** (enmity): Existential threats, zero-sum
2. **Lockean** (rivalry): Sovereignty respected, limited war
3. **Kantian** (friendship): Collective security, rule-following

**Analytical Framework**:
- Map actor identities (status quo/revisionist, civilizational)
- Identify salient norms (sovereignty, R2P, non-interference)
- Trace norm emergence, cascade, and internalization
- Assess rhetorical entrapment effects

**QGIA Integration**: Norm violation red lines, ideational coalition formation.

### 3.2 Critical Constructivism (Finnemore, Sikkink)

**Focus**: Norm life cycles, socialization, and change

**Norm Cascade Model**:
1. **Emergence**: Norm entrepreneurs advocate novel standards
2. **Cascade**: Tipping point (1/3 states) triggers widespread adoption
3. **Internalization**: Norm becomes taken-for-granted, habitual

**QGIA Integration**: Emerging norms on cyber sovereignty, AI governance, space militarization.

## 4. ADDITIONAL PARADIGMS

### 4.1 Marxism / World-Systems Theory (Wallerstein)

**Core Tenets**:
- Capitalist world-economy structures international relations
- Core-periphery exploitation drives conflict
- Hegemonic cycles tied to capital accumulation
- Systemic crises produce wars and restructuring

**QGIA Integration**: Limited—use for economic dependency analysis, resource conflicts in Global South.

### 4.2 English School (Bull, Watson)

**Core Tenets**:
- International society exists alongside anarchy
- States bound by shared norms, institutions
- Pluralist vs. solidarist orientations
- Great powers as system managers

**QGIA Integration**: Great power concert analysis, responsibility norms in P5 behavior.

### 4.3 Feminist IR (Enloe, Tickner)

**Core Tenets**:
- Gender structures power relations
- Masculinist assumptions pervade security studies
- Militarization reinforces patriarchal hierarchies

**QGIA Integration**: Peripheral—use for conflict-affected populations analysis, gender-based targeting in hybrid warfare.

## 5. MULTI-PARADIGM FORECASTING METHODOLOGY

### 5.1 Theory Complementarity Matrix

| Phenomenon | Primary Theory | Supporting Theories | Confidence |
|------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Great power war risk | Realism | Liberalism (veto points) | High |
| Alliance formation | Realism (threat) | Constructivism (identity) | High |
| Trade disputes | Liberalism | Realism (security externalities) | Medium |
| Norm emergence | Constructivism | Liberalism (institutions) | Medium |
| Cyber escalation | Realism (offense-defense) | Constructivism (norms) | Low |

### 5.2 Analytical Decision Tree

**Step 1**: Identify phenomenon (war, alliance, cooperation, norm shift)  
**Step 2**: Apply dominant paradigm baseline  
**Step 3**: Test auxiliary hypotheses from competing paradigms  
**Step 4**: Weight predictions by empirical track record  
**Step 5**: Quantify uncertainty ranges via paradigm divergence

### 5.3 Paradigm-Specific Forecasting Biases

**Realism**: Overestimates conflict risk, underestimates cooperation durability  
**Liberalism**: Overestimates institutions/interdependence constraining power  
**Constructivism**: Difficult to operationalize, measurement validity concerns  

**QGIA Standard**: Generate baseline forecast from realism, adjust upward for liberal/constructivist factors, quantify residual uncertainty.

- Constructivist pathway as decoherence trigger (norm shifts)

### 6.2 Theory-Specific Indicators

**Realist Indicators**:
- Military expenditure trends (% GDP)
- Force modernization timelines
- Alliance formation against common threat
- Strategic resource competition

**Liberal Indicators**:
- Trade interdependence indices
- Institutional membership/compliance

- Economic sanctions efficacy

**Constructivist Indicators**:
- Discourse analysis (identity frames)
- Normative justifications for behavior
- International socialization patterns
- Rhetorical entrapment evidence

### 6.3 Confidence Calibration by Theory

**High Confidence** (0.75-1.00):  
- Realist predictions in great power dyads with clear capability trends  
- Liberal predictions in dense institutional environments  

**Medium Confidence** (0.50-0.74):  
- Constructivist predictions with clear norm cascades  
- Liberal predictions when interdependence contradicts security concerns  

**Low Confidence** (0.00-0.49):  
- Constructivist predictions in norm emergence phase  
- Competing paradigm predictions with no empirical tiebreaker

## 7. CASE STUDY APPLICATIONS

### 7.1 China-Taiwan Contingency

**Realist Lens**: PLA modernization enables coercive reunification; US balancing response likely; capability window closing drives urgency.  
**Confidence**: 0.82

**Liberal Lens**: Economic interdependence (40% of global semiconductor supply) raises costs; institutional constraints (WTO, APEC) limit escalation.  
**Confidence**: 0.64

**Constructivist Lens**: CCP legitimacy tied to reunification narrative; US identity as Pacific power necessitates intervention; face-saving off-ramps critical.  
**Confidence**: 0.58

**Composite QGIA Forecast**: 35-45% probability of coercive action by 2030; realist factors dominant but liberal/constructivist constraints reduce immediacy.

### 7.2 Russia-NATO Baltic Contingency

**Realist Lens**: NATO expansion perceived as existential threat; A2/AD bubble creates fait accompli temptation; nuclear escalation to de-escalate doctrine.  
**Confidence**: 0.78

**Liberal Lens**: NATO Article 5 credibility, EU economic leverage, energy interdependence constraints.  
**Confidence**: 0.61

**Constructivist Lens**: Russian civilizational identity vs. West; NATO normative framework (humanitarian intervention precedent) reduces deterrence clarity.  
**Confidence**: 0.52

**Composite QGIA Forecast**: 15-25% probability of limited probe (Suwalki Corridor) in crisis scenario; realist logic strong but NATO institutional resilience high.

## 8. THEORETICAL BLIND SPOTS AND LIMITATIONS

### 8.1 Known Weaknesses

**All Paradigms**:
- Weak predictive power for specific timing/location
- Tendency toward determinism (structural or ideational)
- Limited microfoundations (leader psychology, bureaucratic politics)
- Poor explanatory power for rapid shifts (Arab Spring, USSR collapse)

**Realism**: Overestimates balancing, underestimates bandwagoning; struggles with intra-alliance dynamics; assumes unitary rational actors.

**Liberalism**: Overstates institution robustness to power shifts; interdependence can be weaponized; democratic peace may be spurious (selection effects).

**Constructivism**: Measurement challenges, ex-post rationalization risks, unclear scope conditions for norm efficacy.

### 8.2 Emerging Theoretical Frontiers

**Required Additions to QGIA Framework**:
1. **Behavioral IR**: Prospect theory, cognitive biases, poliheuristic decision models
2. **Domestic Politics**: Diversionary war theory, audience costs, selectorate theory
3. **Information Environment**: Perception management, strategic narratives, deepfake impacts
4. **Technology-Driven Change**: AI decision-making, autonomous weapons, cyber attribution
